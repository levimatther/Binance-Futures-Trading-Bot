#### Creating Custom Strategies: ####
__Strategies are implemented in Bot_Class as functions in Make_decision()__
* ```Make_decision()``` must return ```Trade_Direction, stop_loss_val, take_profit_val``` for the strategy to work properly
* You might draw inspiration for a strategy from one of the samples in __TradingStrats.py__

## Binance Setup ##
* Create a [Binance Account](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=BKR8BMMP) (This link uses my referral which gives you 5% kickback on trades & would be greatly appreciated)
* __Enable Two-factor Authentication in the security section to keep your crypto safe.__
* Create a new API key under the API Management section.
*  [âœ“] Read Info [âœ“] Enable Trading [âœ“] Enable Futures [X] Enable Withdrawals
* Whitelist your IP address to further secure your account, and so that your API keys don't expire after 3 months.
* Fill in your api keys into api_secret and api_key in __Config_File.py__

### For running Bot with cloud provider, Run directly from Live_Bot.py as you can't use the GUI through ssh ###
__Run strategies at your own risk I am not responsible for your trading decisions, futures are risky and proper risk management should be adhered to at all times, always have a stoploss__
```commandline
python3 Live_Bot.py
```
* Settings are in __Config_File.py__
* Trade a single position at a time by setting ```Number_Of_Trades = 1```, to trade multiple coins just increment this value.
* ```leverage``` and ```order_Size``` should be changed according to your preference
* ```symbol[]``` is a list of the symbols you wish to trade, If you wish to trade all symbols set ```Trade_All_Coins = True```.
* __Trailing stop: set ```use_trailing_stop = 1``` and change ```trailing_stop_percent``` to suit your strategy to use the trailing stop (Min val .001 i.e .1%, Max 5 i.e. 5%). The trailing stop will be placed when the take profit value margin of increase/decrease is reached from your strategy__.
* To close a trade based off a condition check_close_pos() must return a close_pos flag.
* ```strategy``` is the name of the strategy you want to use, see below for adding your own custom strategies.
* There are 11 default strategies to choose from: StochRSIMACD, tripleEMAStochasticRSIATR, tripleEMA, breakout, stochBB, goldenCross,
candle_wick, fibMACD, EMA_cross, heikin_ashi_ema2 & heikin_ashi_ema
* ```TP_SL_choice``` correspond to the type of SL/TP seen in the dropdowns in the GUI see below for adding custom ones.
* ```SL_mult``` and ```TP_mult``` correspond to the numbers preceding the TP and SL choice dropdowns.
* Choose the ```Interval``` you want to trade and the ```buffer``` of candlesticks your strategy will need this will be dependent on indicators you need to ensure you have a sufficient buffer, or you will get errors. 
* Buffer sizes should be about 5 times the length of your largest EMA. In TradingStrats.py you'll find all the strategies, taking ```tripleEMAStochasticRSIATR``` as an example:  
That strategy has a 50EMA as its largest EMA, so you need at least 250 candles.
If you're trading the:
  * 1m timeframe this would be 250 minutes buffer 
  * 3m timeframe would be 750 minutes buffer 
  * 5m timeframe would be 1250 minutes buffer 
  etc...  
(not sure that this is valid buffer input but you can convert these amounts to hours/ days) 


__Docker container creation__:
* Navigate to the project directory in your terminal window
* Run the following Command this will create a docker image with the current state of your Config.py and choice of strategy in Bot_Class.py:

Sample docker commands that I use, __note yours may be different__ (`sudo` may not be needed for you, I am on Linux):
```shell
sudo docker build --tag live_bot .
sudo docker run -it live_bot
```

### GUI for Backtesting and Live Trading ###
* Run ```app.py``` to get the GUI
```commandline
python3 app.py
```

![](files/Live_Trading.PNG)
![](files/Backtester.PNG)

Backtests are displayed in the terminal while running, the results are then saved to a csv file in the Backtests directory along with a graph image and trades taken graphs (see below).
![](files/BacktesterLog.PNG)


* Otherwise run a backtest from the ```Backtester.py``` Script by configuring the inputs found in: 
```
__name__ == "__main__":
```
Backtests are saved in a folder named backtests on completion of a backtest, along with a csv file of the trades taken.
An interactive html file is generated for each trade (using [plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/)), so you can do analysis on winning and losing trades.
